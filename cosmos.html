            <h2>WELCOME TO THE MAGIC OF COSMOS!</h2>
          <h1>COSMOS</h1>
          <p>The cosmos, a vast and mysterious expanse, stretches out into infinity,
            captivating the human imagination with its profound beauty and boundless wonders.
            This celestial realm encompasses everything that exists, from the dazzling galaxies 
            millions of light-years away to the smallest subatomic particles. Within the cosmos,
            stars are born, burn brightly, and eventually fade away, while planets dance in intricate 
            orbits, harboring the potential for life. The cosmos has been a source of inspiration for
            philosophers, scientists, and dreamers alike, encouraging us to explore its depths and 
            unravel its secrets. It reminds us of our place in the universe, connecting us to the 
            grand tapestry of existence and inspiring us to reach for the stars in our quest for understanding
            and exploration.</p></video>

      <h1>EXPLORE THE COSMOS</h1>
      <p>Exploring the cosmos is a boundless journey of discovery that captivates the human spirit. 
        From the depths of our own solar system to the farthest reaches of the universe, scientists 
        and astronomers have embarked on missions to unravel the mysteries of space. Telescopes, 
        spacecraft, and rovers have allowed us to glimpse distant planets, study celestial phenomena, 
        and search for signs of extraterrestrial life. This cosmic exploration not only expands our 
        knowledge of the cosmos but also fosters a profound sense of wonder and awe, reminding us of 
        the vastness and complexity of the universe that surrounds us. It is a testament to human 
        curiosity and our unyielding quest to understand the cosmos and our place within it.</p>

          <h2>Heliocentrism</h2>
          <p>One of the most groundbreaking revelations in the history of cosmology was the realization
             that the Earth orbits the Sun. This heliocentric model of the solar system, famously 
             proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century and later refined by Johannes Kepler
              and Galileo Galilei, revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos. It replaced the 
              geocentric view, where Earth was believed to be the center of the universe, and laid the 
              foundation for modern astronomy.</p>

          <h2>Expansion of the Universe</h2>
          <p>Hubble led to the stunning discovery that the universe is expanding. Hubble's observations 
            of distant galaxies showed that they were receding from us, and this led to the formulation
             of Hubble's Law, which demonstrated that the universe is not static but instead continually
              expanding. This revelation fundamentally changed our perception of the cosmos and ultimately
               gave rise to the Big Bang theory, providing a framework for understanding the origin and 
               evolution of the universe.</p>
